#Place to practice the collaborative coding workflow

### Note: this is a workflow where one person (me, Emily) is the owner of a repository.
#### Workflow is slightly different if multiple people are _collaborators_ on a project (i.e. have write permissions)
#### In this workflow, 

To change a document here, do the following:
+ Click on **'fork'** in the upper right habd of this page, to create YOUR personal branch of this repository. Create it under your username, as prompted.
+ This should create a copy of this repository on *your* github page - under yourusername/practice (will no longer say ehbaker/practice at top of page).
+ Nice work! You have a personal copy of this repository... online. But we want to get it onto your personal machine.
+ To make a local copy, you will **clone** the repository.
+ Open Git Bash on your machine (if you don't have it yet, [download](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)).
+ Use `cd` (change directory) and tab-completion in this command line interface to move to the folder where you want to keep your local copy of this GUI.
  + If you want to put it on your desktop, navigate to your desktop (a folder called mbGUI will be created during clone).
  + The text in yellow gives your location; also typing `pwd` in the prompt will print your current location.
  + `..` means 'go up a directory'; from _c/Users/yourusername_, type `cd Desktop` to go to the desktop.
+ Back on your github page (**yourusername/practice**), click the green 'Clone or Download' button. Copy the address of the git repository shown there, something like https://github.com/yourusername/practice.git
+ Clone the directory with Git Bash by entering `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/practice.git` (with copied git address)
+ A new folder will appear titled **practice** - this has all the files in this repository.

### Yay! Now you can edit the files on your local machine!! Woop!!
